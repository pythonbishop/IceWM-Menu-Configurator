# IceWM-Menu-Configurator
A simple GUI interface to create IceWM menu config files.

This program was created with Python 3.11.0, I can not guarantee that it will function correctly with any future or previous versions. It requires no packages outside the Standard Library.

The Load File option is not currently implemented.
